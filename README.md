## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version >= 10.x)
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkhtarShadab/MerN1
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd MerN1
npm install
```

3. Configure MongoDB:

   - Open the \`app.js\` file and locate the following line:

   ```javascript
   mongoose.connect(
   \`mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<CLUTER_NAME>.mongodb.net/\${process.env.DB_NAME}?retryWrites=true&w=majority\`
   )
   ```

   - Replace the connection string with your MongoDB connection string.

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on port 5000. You can access the application by navigating to \`http://localhost:5000\` in your web browser.

The following API endpoints are available:

### Places Routes

- **GET /api/places/:placeId**: Retrieve a specific place by ID.
- **GET /api/places/user/:userId**: Retrieve all places belonging to a specific user.
- **POST /api/places**: Create a new place.
- **PATCH /api/places/:placeId**: Update a specific place.

### Users Routes

## Error Handling

Errors are handled using a custom \`HttpError\` model. If an error occurs during the request processing, an appropriate error message and status code are returned.

## File Storage

Uploaded images are stored in the \`uploads/images\` directory. The application uses the \`express.static\` middleware to serve these files.
